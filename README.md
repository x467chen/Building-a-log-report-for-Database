CREATE VIEW views

GROUP BY articles.title
ORDER BY num desc;
```
create view bestAuthor (authorID, number of view)
``` xml
CREATE VIEW bestAuthor
AS SELECT articles.author, count(*) as num
FROM articles join log
on log.path LIKE CONCAT('/article/', articles.slug) 
GROUP BY articles.id
ORDER BY num desc;
```
#create view requestLog(date, requesttime)
``` xml
CREATE VIEW requestLog
AS SELECT date(log.time) AS date, count(*) as requestTime
FROM log
Group by date;
```
create view errorLog(date, errortime)
``` xml
CREATE VIEW errorLog
AS SELECT date(log.time) AS date, count(*) as errorTime
FROM log
WHERE log.status != '200 OK'
GROUP BY date;
```
create view TotalLog(date, errortime, requesttime)
``` xml
CREATE VIEW TotalLog
AS SELECT errorLog.date, errortime, requesttime
FROM requestLog, errorLog
WHERE requestLog.date=errorLog.date;
```
